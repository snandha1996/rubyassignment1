1) The error is in 14th line

ex4.rb:14: undefined local variable or method `carpool_capacity' for
    main:Object (NameError)

The variable 'carpool_capacity' is expected to print as per 14 line. 
But the variable had no value as it was not assigned with any value

This line would have been missed: 
carpool_capacity = cars_driven * space_in_a_car

2) I used 4.0 for space_in_a_car, but is that necessary? What happens if it's just 4?

Not necessary as the seats in a car, will always be a whole number.
It can be as 4
